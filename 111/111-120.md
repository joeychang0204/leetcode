## 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

.  
- sol - dfs with depth, leaf -> left is None and right is None 

## 112. Path Sum
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

.  
.  
.  
- sol : recursive. if leaf, check sum == root.val

## 113. Path Sum II
Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

- sol : dfs recording path, pass path+[node.val] in dfs call, don’t append or add outside  

## 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.
.  
.

.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
- sol : solve recursively. traverse right first.
- use global variable to save prev, which should be root.right.

## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
Given a binary tree
struct TreeLinkNode {
TreeLinkNode *left;
TreeLinkNode *right;
TreeLinkNode *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Note:
You may only use constant extra space.
Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
.  
.

.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
- sol : if has left, point it’s next to right. 
- if has right, points its next to root’s next’s left
- sol2 : iterative, from top level to bottom level, keep moving to next and connect

## 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
Given a binary tree
struct TreeLinkNode {
TreeLinkNode *left;
TreeLinkNode *right;
TreeLinkNode *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Note:
You may only use constant extra space.
Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

- sol : iterative, similar to 116, handle more if statements
- case : the first node in next level is not a left node(have to find the head of next level)

## 118. Pascal’s Triangle
Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
- sol : check j-1 >= 0 and j < len(prev)

## 119. Pascal’s Triangle II
Given a non-negative index k where k ≤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
- sol : start from index, should end at rowIndex + 1

## 120. Triangle
Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.
.  
.  
.

.  
- sol : simple dp, for each index j, check if j-1 and j in previous row is valid
