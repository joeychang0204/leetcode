## 186. Reverse Words in a String II
Given an input string , reverse the string word by word. 
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
- sol : first reverse the list, then reverse each word, time=O(n), space=O(1)
- when reversing words, don't include the space

## 187. Repeated DNA Sequence
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.  
Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

- sol : brute force saving in dictinoary, time=O(n), space=O(n)

## 189. Rotate Array
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
- sol1 : naive using list slices, time = O(n), space = O(n)
- (list slicing take O(k) time where k is the len of slice, O(n) space)
- sol2 : reverse three times : the entire list, the first half, the second half

## 190. Reverse Bits
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
- sol : res start from 0, using bit manipulation. time = O(1), space = O(1)
- bitwise operators' priority are less than +, -, so brackets are necessary
