## 252. Meeting Rooms
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), determine if a person could attend all meetings.

- sol : sort using start time. time=O(nlogn), space=O(1)

## 253. Meeting Rooms II
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
- sol1 : use min heap to keep track of the min end time. If the start time >= min end time, then we can use that room. time=O(nlogn), space=O(n)
- sol2 : sort start time and end time individually, use 2 pointers and compare start[sptr] and end[eptr]. If start >= end, then we can use that room. time=O(nlogn), space=O(n)
