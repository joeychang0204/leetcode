## 261. Graph Valid Tree
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.  
Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0,1] is the same as [1,0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

### tree - acyclic + connected. union find. merge one's root under the other's root. check the number of edges at the end(for connected). time=O(n^2), space=O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        parent = [-1] * n
        def find(p):
            return p if parent[p] == -1 else find(parent[p])
        for edge in edges:
            p0, p1 = find(edge[0]), find(edge[1])
            # check cycle
            if p0 == p1:
                return False
            parent[p1] = p0
        return len(edges) == n-1
```
