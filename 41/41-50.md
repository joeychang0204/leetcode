## 46. Permutations
Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.

- basic backtracking
- can also solve iteratively, be careful of the range

## 47. Permutations II
Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.
.

- similar to 46

## 48.Rotate Image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.
Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

- first transpose, next reverse

## 49. group anagrams
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

Example:
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
["ate","eat","tea"],
["nat","tan"],
["bat"]
]
Note:
All inputs will be in lowercase.
The order of your output does not matter.

- use dictionary to solve this problem
- key for dic : sorted word, character count of word, 26 primes timing integer
- list.append() doesnâ€™t return anything, use list + [word] instead

## 50. Pow(x, n)
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

- iteratively : n = n >> 1
- recursively : n % 2 == 0 ? return self.myPow(x*x, n/2) : return x * self.myPow(x*x, n/2)
